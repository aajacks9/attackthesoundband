<h3>Lead Vocalist/Guitarist</h3>

<h3>Founder of 7 years</h3>

<p>Growing up in a musical family he began singing in the Sunday choir until he found his love was for creating 
and performing music. He started writing poems and such in 1998 and in 2002 he started learning how to 
play bass guitar. Around that same time he found his grandfatherâ€™s old acoustic and taught himself to play, 
transforming those poems to catchy lyrics and passionate songs. Years later his passions would lead him to start a band and 
over the course of 4 years would develop into <i>Attack the Sound</i>. When he is not rocking the stage at 
sold out shows he (enjoys long walks on the beach and puppies) coaches gymnastics for the Chicago Park 
District and serve as the first line of defense as an Army Reservist. He enjoys the duality of his life and 
plans to continue coaching as he climbs the ladders of success so that his students will always continue 
to chase their dreams. He'd rather be happy doing what he loves than miserable doing something 
that is comfortable.</p>
