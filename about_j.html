<h3>Trumpet Player, Engineer</h3>

<h3>Joined May 2017</h3>

<p>Playing trumpet for about 14 years, he was introduced to <i>Attack The Sound</i> 
by the saxophonist to accompany them for a show. After David heard his recording 
 he was asked to join the group. Playing with <i>Attack The Sound</i> has been a very humble and enjoyable 
experience. Being with that much talent it encourages him to become better as a musician all around, 
and creativity flows effortlessly when they all get together to come up with new songs, or to 
practice music in general. In his free time he is an Audio Engineer, and he also helps to engineer 
songs for release with <i>Attack The Sound</i>. Because of his freedom of creativity with the band, 
he feels he can always bring new ideas to the table with clients he works with on how to make their music better 
and really dope. </p>
