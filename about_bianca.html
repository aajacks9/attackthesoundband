<p>I am Bianca Shaw, singer, songwriter, hip hop emcee and drummer from the North Lawndale area in Chicago, Illinois.  
I have been writing and practicing my craft since I can remember, starting with singing in a church choir where my mother 
was director and lead singer. I also started playing the drums at church when an old drummer donated his starter set. 
I started playing with two long screws I found because I didn't have sticks, and I would always ask to practice or play 
at rehearsals. One day the pastors aid saw how dedicated I was and presented me with my first pair of sticks!</p>

<p>My sisters and I thought we were doing it  big when we started a rock band in our toy room. We sang and choreographed 
 dances to perform for our parents and at family functions. I remember my older brothers and his friends always 
 freestyling and bumping artists like 2pac, Mos Def, Outkast, Biggie and Lil Wayne, seeing how much they loved the 
 art of hip hop. At a young age I was sitting in my mother's basement and saw a video of a kid with a bandana. 
 It was "Lil Bow Wow" rapping a verse from "Bounce with Me". I said "Whoa..maybe I can be a rapper so I can be his 
 girlfriend." I ran to go grab my composition book and that was the first 64 bars straight I had ever written. I 
 started performing at school talent shows and everyone loved me! The rest is history.</p>

<p>I Attended University of Illinois at Springfield where I completed my degree in communication and broadcast Journalism. 
Even then I recorded in dorm rooms and recorded/engineered myself in the library. Some musical influences include 
Kanye West, Flyleaf, Rihanna, Breaking Benjamin, Missy Elliot, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Eminem. I was discovered 
by David Woulard while performing at an event and asked to join the band as drummer and assist with vocals. I am 
the favorite of the band because I'm awesome ..don't tell anyone I said that. I enjoy Uncle Remus, red wine, and red vines.</p>
