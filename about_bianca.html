<p> Singer, songwriter, hip hop emcee and drummer Bianca Shaw, from the North Lawndale area in Chicago, Illinois has
 been writing and practicing her craft since she can remember. Starting with singing in a church choir where her mother 
was director and lead singer, she started playing the drums when an old drummer donated his starter set. 
She started playing with two long screws she found, and would always ask to practice or play 
at rehearsals. One day the pastor's aid saw how dedicated she was and presented her with her first pair of sticks!</p>

<p>When she was younger she and her sisters thought they were doing it big when they started a rock band in their toy room. 
They sang and choreographed dances to perform for their parents and at family functions. She also remembers her 
older brother and his friends always freestyling and bumping artists like 2pac, Mos Def, Outkast, Biggie and Lil Wayne. 
By seeing how much they loved the art of hip hop she began to develop her own taste for the genre. At a young age she was 
sitting in her mother's basement and saw a video of a kid with a bandana; it was "Lil Bow Wow" rapping a verse from "Bounce with Me". 
Thinking "Whoa...maybe I can be a rapper so I can be his girlfriend?",she ran to go grab her composition book. 
These were the first 64 bars straight she had ever written.</p>

<p> Some musical influences include Kanye West, Flyleaf, Rihanna, Breaking Benjamin, Missy Elliot, Erykah Badu, 
Lauryn Hill, and Eminem. She was approached by David, the lead singer, while performing at an event and asked to join the band as the drummer 
and assist with vocals. The rest is history. She enjoy Uncle Remus, red wine, and red vines.</p>
