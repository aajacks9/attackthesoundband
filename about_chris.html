		<h1>Chris Coleman</h1>
		
		
<h3>Trombonist/ Background Vocalist</h3>

<h3>Joined July 2017</h3>

<p>Originally, he was invited to see the band play at Simone’s in August by their Saxophonist, Oby, 
his frat brother (Delta Omicron Omega Inc.) At that show he was introduced to several of the members and 
started following the band’s Facebook page. He had a feeling that the opportunity would arise to become a 
part of the horn section, and about a month or so later it did when Oby invited him to a rehearsal as a sort 
of audition to become a member of the band. A few nights later he was a member playing at 
the <i>House Party Jam Session</i> that was hosted by the band's leaders, David and Paris. The energy, opportunities, and 
connections have all been very dope so far and he has been extremely grateful to have been given the chance to become 
a part of this family. </p>
<p>Outside of the band, 
he has been doing music for about 12 years, starting with saxophone as his first instrument in high school 
and gradually learning other instruments throughout high school and college. He attended Jackson State 
University at which he was a member of the tuba section of the marching band, the concert wind ensemble, the 
brass ensemble, the vocal jazz ensemble, and the university choir. Currently he is finishing his undergraduate 
education at Chicago State University where he has founded the CSU Hip-Hop Society. Besides being a trombonist 
and vocalist, he also produces, composes and arranges music on his own and he hopes to very soon contribute some 
of his own charts to the band’s repertoire.</p>
