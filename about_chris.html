<h3>Trombonist/ Background Vocalist</h3>

<h3>Joined July 2017</h3>

<p>Originally, I was invited to see the band play at Simone’s in August by Oby, the Saxophonist of the band 
and my frat brother (Delta Omicron Omega Inc.) At that show I was introduced to several of the members and 
started following the band’s Facebook page. I had a feeling that the opportunity would arise for me to become a 
part of the horn section and about a month or so later it did when Oby invited me to a rehearsal as a sort 
of audition to become a member of the band. A few nights later I was a member of the band playing at 
the <i>House Party Jam Session</i> that was hosted by our leaders David and Paris. The energy, opportunities, and 
connections have all been very dope so far and I am extremely grateful to have been given the chance to become 
a part of this family. 
<p>Besides being a trombonist and vocalist, I also produce, compose and arrange music on 
my own and I hope to very soon contribute some of my own charts to the band’s repertoire. Outside of the band, 
I have been doing music for about 12 years, starting with saxophone as my first instrument in high school 
and gradually learning other instruments throughout high school and college. I attended Jackson State 
University at which I was a member of the tuba section of the marching band, the concert wind ensemble, the 
brass ensemble, the vocal jazz ensemble, and the university choir. Currently I am finishing my undergraduate 
education at Chicago State University where I have founded the CSU Hip-Hop society. Other than my musical 
ventures with <i>Attack The Sound</i> I am developing my own brand as an independent hip-hop/neo-soul artist/producer 
under the moniker <i>HalisiSoul</i> with my first singles dropping on December 15th of 2017. I am also a part of 
<i>Planet Saturn</i>, a small collective of creative individuals throughout the city aiming to use their talents 
as a catalyst for social change and the spreading of good (outer worldly) vibes.</p>

<p><i>The brands for <i>HalisiSoul Music</i> are currently under development for Facebook and SoundCloud, with launch dates TBA</i></p>
