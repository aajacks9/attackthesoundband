<h3>Bass Guitarist/Musical Director/Resident Black Samurai</h3>

<h3>February 2017</h3>

<p>Acting as both the bassist and the Musical Director, Oni scores all the music as well as 
directs the band during rehearsals and performances to make certain that musically everything runs smoothly. 
He ended up in the band through Paris J’mal, the drummer, whom he had been playing with in church for a bit, 
as well as with some other acts in town. After proving his skills, a couple of auditions, and proving 
his dedication, he was in. Although he's been playing music since middle school, he didn’t 
begin taking it seriously until 2014, when he was about 24 years old. He started playing music 
as his main career in February of 2017, only a few weeks before he joined <i>Attack The Sound</i>. 
Besides <i>Attack the Sound</i>, he plays for other Chicago artists and is a recording artist for a web series. 
He also has his own FreeJazz/Afro-Progressive music solo project known as <i>Rising Deity</i>.</p> 

<p>Outside of music he is a freelance composer, activist, a martial artist, and one of the biggest 
nerds you’ll ever meet. He love comics, video games, anime and martial arts films.</p>
