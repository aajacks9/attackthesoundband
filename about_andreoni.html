<h3>Bass Guitarist/Musical Director/Resident Black Samurai</h3>

<h3>February 2017</h3>

<p>I act as both the bassist and the Musical Director. As the Musical Director I score 
all the music we compose as well as direct the band during rehearsals and performances to make 
certain that musically everything runs smoothly. I ended up in the band through Paris J’mal, whom I had 
been playing with in church for a bit, as well as some other acts in town. After proving my 
skills to him, he started recommending me to David, and after a couple of auditions, and proving 
my dedication, I was in. I’ve been playing music since I was in middle school, but I didn’t 
begin taking it seriously until 2014 when I was about 24 years old. I started playing music 
as my main career in February of 2017, only a few weeks before I joined Attack The Sound. 
Besides <i>Attack the Sound</i>, I also play for Chicago Emcee, <i>Tony Famous</i>, am a recording artist for the web series, <i>Sessions 
with Tandaleria</i>, and have my own FreeJazz/Progressive music solo project known as <i>Rising Deity</i>. 
Outside of music I’m also a freelance composer, activist, a martial artist, and one of the biggest 
Nerds you’ll ever meet. I love Comics, video games, anime and martial arts films.</p>
